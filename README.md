# Data-Projects

I assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders.  

I was tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. With the help of my Data Science findings and models, the competing startup I've been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.  

This project focuses on hands-on work to demonstrate and apply Data Science methodology.
